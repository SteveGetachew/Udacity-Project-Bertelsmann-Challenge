# Udacity-Project-Bertelsmann-Challenge
Project work as part of Udacity Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge

# Purpose: To familiarize with datasets

# Pre-requisite:
* Install Anaconda (Refer Udacity link if any doubt: <add link> , or use my slack handle jicksy)
* Open Jupyter Notebook 
* The sample notebooks will be provided as .ipynb file, so it will be convenient if you have Anaconda installed. So you just need to run the .ipynb file given inside each dataset folder for starting off.


# Dataset 1: Titanic Dataset
This dataset is one of the most popular datasets from Kaggle. The reason why I chose this dataset is because, there are lots of analysis available online. I have done some initial analysis with the data to start with.

-> Our task is to do further analysis with Titanic dataset, and see what information you can come up with from this dataset. 

-> Feel free to use google to get ideas, and also try to understand how different analysis are driven out from this dataset. 

-> Contribute atleast one meaningful analysis per person and provide steps to do it. (If possible do a pull request, and I'll allow commits to my repository. You can also provide your git repository link and I'll add your link in the first .README file.) 

-> I'll keep a buffer for first week as few of us will have to install 

 1. Anaconda (Refer: )
 2. Python3 
 3. Set up git and familiarize with git commands (A great course by Udacity: )

We can decide on a feasible timing coming weekend and go through everyone's contribution. That way we'll all be able to bring some insights to this dataset. 

Once you are ready to begin please fill up this google sheet with what analysis you would be doing. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N6VcEDzF2y9JLhu6W67wfqcOoRE6jCP9uteWKBy0RKM/edit#gid=1406548495 This way we can minimize two people working on same analysis. Feel free to do some visual plot, derive insights, perform calculation. Well, the field is yours! :)

The more analysis we derive, the merrier it would be! :) Let us learn together!
